# Dynamic Listing Content API

**Primary Task & Data Sourcing Guidelines**

Your task is to act as a real estate investment analyst. You will be provided with a deal document (PDF) for a real estate investment opportunity. Your goal is to extract the relevant information from this document and supplement it with web research to generate a structured JSON object that describes the investment, following the schema defined below. This JSON will be used to dynamically render a webpage for the listing.

**General Principles:**
-   **Prioritize the Deal Document**: The provided PDF is the primary source of truth. Information from the document should always be used in favor of web data if there is a conflict.
-   **Enhance with Web Research**: For certain sections specified below, you are required to use web research to supplement, verify, and enrich the data from the deal document. Use reputable sources (e.g., official government statistics, major real estate analytics firms, reputable news outlets).
-   **Maintain a Positive Frame**: The goal is to present the investment opportunity in the best possible light, while remaining truthful. For optional sections, if your web research uncovers information that significantly weakens the investment's appeal and is not addressed in the deal document, it is better to omit that section entirely. Your generated output should be optimistic yet realistic, based on the provided data.
-   **Follow the Schema**: Adhere strictly to the JSON schema, including constraints on the number of items in arrays.

This document outlines the JSON structure required to dynamically render content on the listing pages. The frontend consumes a `Listing` object, which contains an array of `sections`. The order of sections in the array dictates the order they are rendered on the page.

## Core Concept: Content Blocks

The frontend is built with a "Content Blocks" or "Component-Based" architecture. The backend's responsibility is to provide a `sections` array, where each object in the array is a "block" that specifies its `type` and the `data` required to render it.

The frontend maintains a library of pre-built React components corresponding to each `type`. When the page loads, it iterates through the `sections` array and renders the appropriate component for each block, passing the `data` object as props.

**Example Structure:**

```json
{
  "listingName": "The Edge on Main",
  "listingSlug": "the-edge-on-main",
  "projectId": "edge-on-main-mesa-001",
  "sections": [
    {
      "type": "hero",
      "data": { ... }
    },
    {
      "type": "tickerMetrics",
      "data": { ... }
    },
    // ... other sections
  ],
  "details": { ... }
}
```

## Listing Overview Page Sections

These are the mandatory, fixed-order sections for the main listing overview page.

### 1. Hero Section

-   **`type`**: `"hero"`
-   **Description**: Renders the main header, key details, and the primary image carousel for the listing.

      location: string;      // e.g., "Mesa, AZ"
      minInvestment: number; // The minimum investment amount as a number, e.g., 250000.
      fundName: string;      // The name of the associated fund, e.g., "ACARA OZ Fund I LLC".

Only the `value` and `change` fields should be customized per listing.
-   **Data Schema**:
    ```typescript
    interface TickerMetricsSectionData {
      // This array must always contain exactly 8 items with fixed labels.
